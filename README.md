# AI based Web Article Scraper with NLP
# An AI-powered web article scraper that uses NLP to extract relevant articles on a given topic. This is designed to provide users with a quick and efficient way to access content related to their interests.
 
This is a small Python-based AI project that uses natural language processing (NLP) to extract keywords from input sentences and then searches for related articles. It relies on several AI and ML libraries, including spaCy for NLP tasks, BeautifulSoup4 for web scraping, and requests for HTTP requests. This project can be used as a foundation for developing more complex NLP-based applications that involve keyword extraction.
